# git-training

training on using git

## Man this is complicated

BUT.. we're getting there

## git add not needed?

she said u don't need to use "git add", but u do, or maybe "git commit -a"

trying that now...

No need to use "git add", u can use "git commit -a -m" agreeGe

## Github doesn't need "git add"

THAT'S what she meant, when u create/change something ON GITHUB, there's no "git add" or "add", u just click "commit new file" or "commit changes"

Bro you're dum xD

## Trying branches

"Yer a variant, Harry"

## Now trying conflicts

Captain America: Civil War
OH SHOOT.. git commit -a -m (which can just be -am) only adds MODIFIED files, NOT newly created files

## Again trying conflicts

How I met Your Mother > Friends
