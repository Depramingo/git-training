training on using git

## git add not needed?

she said u don't need to use "git add", but u do, or maybe "git commit -a"

trying that now...

No need to use "git add", u can use "git commit -a -m" agreeGe

## Github doesn't need "git add"

THAT'S what she meant, when u create/change something ON GITHUB, there's no "git add" or "add", u just click "commit new file" or "commit changes"

Bro you're dum xD
